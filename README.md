# Class-Schedule-Creator-for-Google-Calendar
## What does this do?

This script creates a csv file that is in a specified format to import it into google calendar. This is helpful for school/college classes that happen on a recurring weekly basis.

## Steps to use :
1. Change the code (currently set to 6 subjects, coded each subject with a number and also this creates schedule only for 6 weeks)
2. Create a new calendar just for this
3. Run the script and input the timetable
4. Import the file "IMPORT THIS.csv" into the newly made calendar.
5. Thats it! Enjoy!
